   <h4><p>The purpose of the Fundraising events at Arm’s Length are: 
    One, To provides funds to pay for daily organization expenses which enclude to mention a few: maintaining the building,scholarships for any teen or younger adult</h4><h5> like those in the two pictures to the left and to the right</h5><h4>who cannot affort tuition to join our programs, to pay teachers and a little salary for the owners and to buy books and computers for our students.<p>Two, these events provide Internship to our students. We encourage our graduating students to attend the fundraising meetings so they can enhance on the skills they were taughted in class(like community serving, budgeting, time management and socialization), in addition to networking. They achieve this by helping in selling, budgeting, setting-up or decorating rooms, entertaining guests and buying fundraising items.</p></h4>
    <h4><p>Fundrainsings are usually conducted on every 1st Saturday of the following months: February,September,November and December. These months were picked because of the major holidays and important days which fall in them and these are: Valentine, beginning of the Academic year(for September), Thanksgiving and Christmas.We thought people will need to buy gifts around those days or use extra money in September, before the beginning of the academic year. The good thing is that,99% of these items are donated by caring people. Since cars are very expensive, we use some of the organization's money for the months of July and August to buy a brand new car at 85% discount(again we are blessed to have friendly car dealers). Auction for the car is always on the 1st Saturday of September. </p></h4>
